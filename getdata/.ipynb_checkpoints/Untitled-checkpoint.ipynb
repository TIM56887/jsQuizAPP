This means that the variable gets hoisted (memory space is set up during the creation phase) with the default value of undefined, until we actually get to the line where we define the variable. We haven\\'t defined the variable yet on the line where we try to log the name variable, so it still holds the value of undefined.\\nVariables with the let keyword (and const) are hoisted, but unlike var, don\\'t get initialized. They are not accessible before the line we declare (initialize) them. This is called the \"temporal dead zone\". When we try to access the variables before they are declared, JavaScript throws a ReferenceError.\\n\\n', '\\nBecause of the event queue in JavaScript, the setTimeout callback function is called after the loop has been executed. Since the variable i in the first loop was declared using the var keyword, this value was global. During the loop, we incremented the value of i by 1 each time, using the unary operator ++. By the time the setTimeout callback function was invoked, i was equal to 3 in the first example.\\nIn the second loop, the variable i was declared using the let keyword: variables declared with the let (and const) keyword are block-scoped (a block is anything between { }). During each iteration, i will have a new value, and each value is scoped inside the loop.\\n\\n', \"\\nNote that the value of diameter is a regular function, whereas the value of perimeter is an arrow function.\\nWith arrow functions, the this keyword refers to its current surrounding scope, unlike regular functions! This means that when we call perimeter, it doesn't refer to the shape object, but to its surrounding scope (window for example).\\nThere is no value radius on that object, which returns NaN.\\n\\n\", '\\nThe unary plus tries to convert an operand to a number. true is 1, and false is 0.\\nThe string \\'Lydia\\' is a truthy value. What we\\'re actually asking, is \"is this truthy value falsy?\". This returns false.\\n\\n', '\\nIn JavaScript, all object keys are strings (unless it\\'s a Symbol). Even though we might not type them as strings, they are always converted into strings under the hood.\\nJavaScript interprets (or unboxes) statements. When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket [ and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket ]. Only then, it will evaluate the statement.\\nmouse[bird.size]: First it evaluates bird.size, which is \"small\". mouse[\"small\"] returns true\\nHowever, with dot notation, this doesn\\'t happen. mouse does not have a key called bird, which means that mouse.bird is undefined. Then, we ask for the size using dot notation: mouse.bird.size. Since mouse.bird is undefined, we\\'re actually asking undefined.size. This isn\\'t valid, and will throw an error similar to Cannot read property \"size\" of undefined.\\n\\n', '\\nIn JavaScript, all objects interact by reference when setting them equal to each other.\\nFirst, variable c holds a value to an object. Later, we assign d with the same reference that c has to the object.\\n\\nWhen you change one object, you change all of them.\\n\\n', \"\\nnew Number() is a built-in function constructor. Although it looks like a number, it's not really a number: it has a bunch of extra features and is an object.\\nWhen we use the == operator (Equality operator), it only checks whether it has the same value. They both have the value of 3, so it returns true.\\nHowever, when we use the === operator (Strict equality operator), both value and type should be the same. It's not: new Number() is not a number, it's an object. Both return false.\\n\\n\", '\\nThe colorChange function is static. Static methods are designed to live only on the constructor in which they are created, and cannot be passed down to any children or called upon class instances. Since freddie is an instance of class Chameleon, the function cannot be called upon it. A TypeError is thrown.\\n\\n', '\\nIt logs the object, because we just created an empty object on the global object! When we mistyped greeting as greetign, the JS interpreter actually saw this as:\\n\\nglobal.greetign = {} in Node.js\\nwindow.greetign = {}, frames.greetign = {} and self.greetign in browsers.\\nself.greetign in web workers.\\nglobalThis.greetign in all environments.\\n\\nIn order to avoid this, we can use \"use strict\". This makes sure that you have declared a variable before setting it equal to anything.\\n\\n', \"\\nThis is possible in JavaScript, because functions are objects! (Everything besides primitive types are objects)\\nA function is a special type of object. The code you write yourself isn't the actual function. The function is an object with properties. This property is invocable.\\n\\n\", '\\nIn JavaScript, functions are objects, and therefore, the method getFullName gets added to the constructor function object itself. For that reason, we can call Person.getFullName(), but member.getFullName throws a TypeError.\\nIf you want a method to be available to all object instances, you have to add it to the prototype property:\\nPerson.prototype.getFullName = function() {\\n  return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;\\n};\\n\\n', '\\nFor sarah, we didn\\'t use the new keyword. When using new, this refers to the new empty object we create. However, if you don\\'t add new, this refers to the global object!\\nWe said that this.firstName equals \"Sarah\" and this.lastName equals \"Smith\". What we actually did, is defining global.firstName = \\'Sarah\\' and global.lastName = \\'Smith\\'. sarah itself is left undefined, since we don\\'t return a value from the Person function.\\n\\n', '\\nDuring the capturing phase, the event goes through the ancestor elements down to the target element. It then reaches the target element, and bubbling begins.\\n\\n\\n', \"\\nAll objects have prototypes, except for the base object. The base object is the object created by the user, or an object that is created using the new keyword. The base object has access to some methods and properties, such as .toString. This is the reason why you can use built-in JavaScript methods! All of such methods are available on the prototype. Although JavaScript can't find it directly on your object, it goes down the prototype chain and finds it there, which makes it accessible for you.\\n\\n\", '\\nJavaScript is a dynamically typed language: we don\\'t specify what types certain variables are. Values can automatically be converted into another type without you knowing, which is called implicit type coercion. Coercion is converting from one type into another.\\nIn this example, JavaScript converts the number 1 into a string, in order for the function to make sense and return a value. During the addition of a numeric type (1) and a string type (\\'2\\'), the number is treated as a string. We can concatenate strings like \"Hello\" + \"World\", so what\\'s happening here is \"1\" + \"2\" which returns \"12\".\\n\\n', '\\nThe postfix unary operator ++:\\n\\nReturns the value (this returns 0)\\nIncrements the value (number is now 1)\\n\\nThe prefix unary operator ++:\\n\\nIncrements the value (number is now 2)\\nReturns the value (this returns 2)\\n\\nThis returns 0 2 2.\\n\\n', '\\nIf you use tagged template literals, the value of the first argument is always an array of the string values. The remaining arguments get the values of the passed expressions!\\n\\n', \"\\nWhen testing equality, primitives are compared by their value, while objects are compared by their reference. JavaScript checks if the objects have a reference to the same location in memory.\\nThe two objects that we are comparing don't have that: the object we passed as a parameter refers to a different location in memory than the object we used in order to check equality.\\nThis is why both { age: 18 } === { age: 18 } and { age: 18 } == { age: 18 } return false.\\n\\n\", '\\nThe rest parameter (...args) lets us \"collect\" all remaining arguments into an array. An array is an object, so typeof args returns \"object\"\\n\\n', '\\nWith \"use strict\", you can make sure that you don\\'t accidentally declare global variables. We never declared the variable age, and since we use \"use strict\", it will throw a reference error. If we didn\\'t use \"use strict\", it would have worked, since the property age would have gotten added to the global object.\\n\\n', \"\\neval evaluates codes that's passed as a string. If it's an expression, like in this case, it evaluates the expression. The expression is 10 * 10 + 5. This returns the number 105.\\n\\n\", \"\\nThe data stored in sessionStorage is removed after closing the tab.\\nIf you used localStorage, the data would've been there forever, unless for example localStorage.clear() is invoked.\\n\\n\", \"\\nWith the var keyword, you can declare multiple variables with the same name. The variable will then hold the latest value.\\nYou cannot do this with let or const since they're block-scoped and therefore can't be redeclared.\\n\\n\", \"\\nAll object keys (excluding Symbols) are strings under the hood, even if you don't type it yourself as a string. This is why obj.hasOwnProperty('1') also returns true.\\nIt doesn't work that way for a set. There is no '1' in our set: set.has('1') returns false. It has the numeric type 1, set.has(1) returns true.\\n\\n\", '\\nIf you have two keys with the same name, the key will be replaced. It will still be in its first position, but with the last specified value.\\n\\n', \"\\nThe base execution context is the global execution context: it's what's accessible everywhere in your code.\\n\\n\", '\\nThe continue statement skips an iteration if a certain condition returns true.\\n\\n', '\\nString is a built-in constructor, which we can add properties to. I just added a method to its prototype. Primitive strings are automatically converted into a string object, generated by the string prototype function. So, all strings (string objects) have access to that method!\\n\\n', '\\nObject keys are automatically converted into strings. We are trying to set an object as a key to object a, with the value of 123.\\nHowever, when we stringify an object, it becomes \"[object Object]\". So what we are saying here, is that a[\"[object Object]\"] = 123. Then, we can try to do the same again. c is another object that we are implicitly stringifying. So then, a[\"[object Object]\"] = 456.\\nThen, we log a[b], which is actually a[\"[object Object]\"]. We just set that to 456, so it returns 456.\\n\\n', '\\nWe have a setTimeout function and invoked it first. Yet, it was logged last.\\nThis is because in browsers, we don\\'t just have the runtime engine, we also have something called a WebAPI. The WebAPI gives us the setTimeout function to start with, and for example the DOM.\\nAfter the callback is pushed to the WebAPI, the setTimeout function itself (but not the callback!) is popped off the stack.\\n\\nNow, foo gets invoked, and \"First\" is being logged.\\n\\nfoo is popped off the stack, and baz gets invoked. \"Third\" gets logged.\\n\\nThe WebAPI can\\'t just add stuff to the stack whenever it\\'s ready. Instead, it pushes the callback function to something called the queue.\\n\\nThis is where an event loop starts to work. An event loop looks at the stack and task queue. If the stack is empty, it takes the first thing on the queue and pushes it onto the stack.\\n\\nbar gets invoked, \"Second\" gets logged, and it\\'s popped off the stack.\\n\\n', '\\nThe deepest nested element that caused the event is the target of the event. You can stop bubbling by event.stopPropagation\\n\\n', '\\nIf we click p, we see two logs: p and div. During event propagation, there are 3 phases: capturing, target, and bubbling. By default, event handlers are executed in the bubbling phase (unless you set useCapture to true). It goes from the deepest nested element outwards.\\n\\n', '\\nWith both, we can pass the object to which we want the this keyword to refer to. However, .call is also executed immediately!\\n.bind. returns a copy of the function, but with a bound context!

However, since it's a new line, the engine doesn't know that it's actually the value that we wanted to return. Instead, it automatically added a semicolon after return. You could see this as:\\nreturn;\\na + b;\\nThis means that a + b is never reached, since a function stops running after the return keyword.

The value of y is an array, containing all the rest parameters. The value of x is equal to 1 in this case, so when we log [x, y], [1, [2, 3, 4]] gets logged.\\nThe getUser function receives an object. With arrow functions, we don\\'t have to write curly brackets if we just return one value.

In this example, JavaScript tries to find a property called colors on the colorConfig object. There is no property called colors, so this returns undefined. Then, we try to access the value of the first element by using [1]. We cannot do this on a value that\\'s undefined, so it throws a TypeError: Cannot read property \\'1\\' of undefined.\\nJavaScript interprets (or unboxes) statements. When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket [ and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket ]. Only then, it will evaluate the statement.

A string is a primitive data type, and interact by value (see my blogpost if you're interested in learning more)\\nThen, we change the value of the favoriteFood property on the info object. The food array hasn't changed, since the value of favoriteFood was merely a copy of the value of the first element in the array, and doesn't have a reference to the same spot in memory as the element on food[0].

When logging the value of user.email, the original value of my@email.com gets returned.\\n\\n', '\\nThe Promise.all method runs the passed promises in parallel. If one promise fails, the Promise.all method rejects with the value of the rejected promise. In this case, promise3 rejected with the value \"Third\". We’re catching the rejected value in the chained catch method on the runPromises invocation to catch any errors  within the runPromises function. Only \"Third\" gets logged, since promise3 rejected with this value.\\n\\n', '\\nThe fromEntries method turns a 2d array into an object. The first element in each subarray will be the key, and the second element in each subarray will be the value. In this case, we’re mapping over the keys array, which returns an array which first element is the item on the key array on the current index, and the second element is the item of the values array on the current index.\\nThis creates an array of subarrays containing the correct keys and values, which results in { name: \"Lydia\", age: 22 }\\n\\n', \"\\nThe default value of address is an empty object {}.

In this case, the returned value of typeof randomValue is the truthy value \"number\", meaning that the value of !typeof randomValue is the boolean value false.\\n!typeof randomValue === \"string\" always returns false, since we\\'re actually checking false === \"string\".
